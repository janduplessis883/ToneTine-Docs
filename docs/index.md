## What is ToneTint?
**ToneTint** is a Python package that provides an intuitive way to perform sentiment analysis on text data and visualize the results. It splits the input text into manageable chunks, analyzes each chunk using a pre-trained sentiment analysis model, and highlights the text with background colors corresponding to the sentiment. Additionally, it displays tooltips with detailed sentiment scores when hovering over each text chunk. Perfect for Jupyter Notebooks & Steamlit.
